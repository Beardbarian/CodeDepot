1. Open your SentinelOne console and navigate to Sentinels > Packages. 
2. Download the SentinelOneInstaller_windows_64bit_v24_1_5_277.exe file and save it onto the endpoint. 
3. Boot the endpoint into Safe Mode. 
4. Run the following commands in Command Prompt as an Administrator: > 
cd *path to folder where the installation package resides*  
SentinelOneInstaller_windows_64bit_v24_1_5_277.exe -c
5. After some time, another Command Prompt box will pop up indicating the endpoint can be restarted. You can then restart the endpoint, and the agent should then be removed. 
6. If you wish to reinstall the agent, another installation of the agent can be performed once booted into normal Windows mode.
